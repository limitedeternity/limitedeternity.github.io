Hello! My name is **Vyacheslav**. For simplicity, you can call me **V**.

I solve sudoku with a permanent marker, listen to synthwave, fix primus and take part in CTF contests.

I'm an IT enthusiast with a wide range of languages, tools, and completed projects in the background. I'm attracted to the creative side of IT - as a writer expresses his ideas through words, I express them in the form of commands to a computing device.

I'm currently studying at the Russian State Pedagogical University named after A.I. Herzen in the field of information systems and technologies (2018-2022). 

There I'll publish my thoughts and researches.
